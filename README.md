# Got Lost? A lost and found software. 

This is a work in progress app. Working together with a Berlin venue this app will help organize the lost and found department. 
If someone lost something they can create an inquiry online. This will appear in a yet to be coded android app where it can 
be matched with found items. This way the company will get rid of complicated email communication. When an item is found 
employees will make a photo using the app and enter meta data to the item. The photo is sent to an AI service such as google lens and is tagged by it.

The software features a localized react frontend which is already working. The backend is run on a spring boot service with a postgres db behind it.
